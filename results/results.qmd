## Sensitivity of tree growth to precipitation in seasonally dry tropical forests using long-term dendrometer band measurements

## Objective

::: {.columns}
::: {.column width="40%"}

Disentangling the effects of size, exposure and water availability on drought sensitivity of tree growth

## Defining drought sensitivity

$sensitivity_{tree} = \frac{drought.year.increment - mean.annual.increment_{tree}}{mean.annual.increment_{tree}}$

How well do species traits predict average sensitivity of species?

$sensitivity_{tree}~ 1+ (1|Species)$

## Models

We ran 3 different models

1. varying intercepts by species  
$sensitivity_{tree} = \beta_{DBH}DBH_{0} + \beta_{TWI}TWI + \beta_{CII}CII_{0} + (1|Species)$

2. varying intercepts + predictors scaled within species  
$sensitivity_{tree} = \beta_{DBH}DBH_sp_{0} + \beta_{TWI}TWI_sp + \beta_{CII}CII_sp_{0} + (1|Species)$

3. varying slopes + predictors scaled within species  
$sensitivity_{tree} = \beta_{DBH}DBH_sp_{0} + \beta_{TWI}TWI_sp + \beta_{CII}CII_sp_{0} + (1+DBH+CII+TWI|Species)$

Variation in sensitivity among individuals was explained more by crown exposure than size per se

## Higher exposure was associated with more negative growth sensitivities across species

::: {.columns}
::: {.column width="30%"}
To corroborate these results we modelled growth occurrence as a binary response.

And found similar, stronger influence of exposure on growth occurrence

## When modelled without exposure, the effect of size was more negative as exposure is strongly predicted by size

This implies mediation effects of size on exposure

## Take-home messages

1. In 2015, the stronger ENSO drought, deciduous and slow-growing species had stronger negative sensitivities.
2. While two droughts decreased growth on most trees, more exposed trees were more negatively impacted than their less exposed counterparts
3. While exposure effects were stronger than size effects on drought sensitivity, we see mediation effects.
