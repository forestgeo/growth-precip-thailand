  abstract = {Forests are major components of the global carbon (C) cycle and thereby strongly influence atmospheric carbon dioxide (CO2) and climate. However, efforts to incorporate forests into climate models and CO2 accounting frameworks have been constrained by a lack of accessible, global-scale synthesis on how C cycling varies across forest types and stand ages. Here, we draw from the Global Forest Carbon Database, ForC, to provide a macroscopic overview of C cycling in the world's forests, giving special attention to stand age-related variation. Specifically, we use 11 923 ForC records for 34 C cycle variables from 865 geographic locations to characterize ensemble C budgets for four broad forest types---tropical broadleaf evergreen, temperate broadleaf, temperate conifer, and boreal. We calculate means and standard deviations for both mature and regrowth (age {$<$} 100 years) forests and quantify trends with stand age in regrowth forests for all variables with sufficient data. C cycling rates generally decreased from tropical to temperate to boreal in both mature and regrowth forests, whereas C stocks showed less directional variation. Mature forest net ecosystem production did not differ significantly among biomes. The majority of flux variables, together with most live biomass pools, increased significantly with the logarithm of stand age. As climate change accelerates, understanding and managing the carbon dynamics of forests is critical to forecasting, mitigation, and adaptation. This comprehensive and synthetic global overview of C stocks and fluxes across biomes and stand ages contributes to these efforts.},

  abstract = {Global change is impacting forests worldwide, threatening biodiversity and ecosystem services including climate regulation. Understanding how forests respond is critical to forest conservation and climate protection. This review describes an international network of 59 long-term forest dynamics research sites (CTFS-ForestGEO) useful for characterizing forest responses to global change. Within very large plots (median size 25~ha), all stems {$\geq$}1~cm diameter are identified to species, mapped, and regularly recensused according to standardized protocols. CTFS-ForestGEO spans 25{$^\circ$}S--61{$^\circ$}N latitude, is generally representative of the range of bioclimatic, edaphic, and topographic conditions experienced by forests worldwide, and is the only forest monitoring network that applies a standardized protocol to each of the world's major forest biomes. Supplementary standardized measurements at subsets of the sites provide additional information on plants, animals, and ecosystem and environmental variables. CTFS-ForestGEO sites are experiencing multifaceted anthropogenic global change pressures including warming (average 0.61~{$^\circ$}C), changes in precipitation (up to {\textpm}30\% change), atmospheric deposition of nitrogen and sulfur compounds (up to 3.8~g N~m-2~yr-1 and 3.1~g S~m-2~yr-1), and forest fragmentation in the surrounding landscape (up to 88\% reduced tree cover within 5~km). The broad suite of measurements made at CTFS-ForestGEO sites makes it possible to investigate the complex ways in which global change is impacting forest dynamics. Ongoing research across the CTFS-ForestGEO network is yielding insights into how and why the forests are changing, and continued monitoring will provide vital contributions to understanding worldwide forest diversity and dynamics in an era of global change.},

  abstract = {The concept of spatial climate analogs, that is identifying a place with a present-day climate similar to the projections of a place of interest, is a promising method for visualizing and communicating possible effects of climate change. We show that when accounting for seasonal cycles of both temperature and precipitation, it is impossible to find good analogs for projections at many places across the world. For substantial land fractions, primarily in the tropics and subtropics, there are no analogs anywhere with current seasonal cycles of temperature and precipitation matching their projected future conditions. This implies that these places experience the emergence of novel climates. For 1.5 {$^\circ$}C global warming about 15\% and for 2 {$^\circ$}C warming about 21\% of the global land is projected to experience novel climates, whereas for a 4 {$^\circ$}C warming the corresponding novel climates may emerge on more than a third of the global land fraction. Similar fractions of today's climates, mainly found in the tropics, subtropics and polar north, are anticipated to disappear in the future. Note that the exact quantification of the land fraction is sensitive to the threshold selection. Novel and disappearing climates may have serious consequences for impacts that are sensitive to the full seasonal cycle of temperature and precipitation. For individual seasons, however, spatial analogs may still be a powerful tool for climate change communication.},

  abstract = {The climate sensitivity of forest ecosystem woody productivity (ANPPstem) influences carbon cycle responses to climate change. For the first time, we combined long-term annual growth and forest census data of a diverse temperate broadleaf deciduous forest, seeking to resolve whether ANPPstem is primarily moisture- or energy-limited and whether climate sensitivity has changed in recent decades characterised by more mesic conditions and elevated CO2. We analysed tree-ring chronologies across 109 yr of monthly climatic variation (1901--2009) for 14 species representing 97\% of ANPPstem in a 25.6 ha plot in northern Virginia, USA. Radial growth of most species and ecosystem-level ANPPstem responded positively to cool, moist growing season conditions, but the same conditions in the previous May--July were associated with reduced growth. In recent decades (1980--2009), responses were more variable and, on average, weaker. Our results indicated that woody productivity is primarily limited by current growing season moisture, as opposed to temperature or sunlight, but additional complexity in climate sensitivity may reflect the use of stored carbohydrate reserves. Overall, while such forests currently display limited moisture sensitivity, their woody productivity is likely to decline under projected hotter and potentially drier growing season conditions.},

  abstract = {Framed within the Copernicus Climate Change Service (C3S) of the European Commission, the European Centre for Medium-Range Weather Forecasts (ECMWF) is producing an enhanced global dataset for the land component of the fifth generation of European ReAnalysis (ERA5), hereafter referred to as ERA5-Land. Once completed, the period covered will span from 1950 to the present, with continuous updates to support land monitoring applications. ERA5-Land describes the evolution of the water and energy cycles over land in a consistent manner over the production period, which, among others, could be used to analyse trends and anomalies. This is achieved through global high-resolution numerical integrations of the ECMWF land surface model driven by the downscaled meteorological forcing from the ERA5 climate reanalysis, including an elevation correction for the thermodynamic near-surface state. ERA5-Land shares with ERA5 most of the parameterizations that guarantees the use of the state-of-the-art land surface modelling applied to numerical weather prediction (NWP) models. A main advantage of ERA5-Land compared to ERA5 and the older ERA-Interim is the horizontal resolution, which is enhanced globally to 9 km compared to 31 km (ERA5) or 80 km (ERA-Interim), whereas the temporal resolution is hourly as in ERA5. Evaluation against independent in situ observations and global model or satellite-based reference datasets shows the added value of ERA5-Land in the description of the hydrological cycle, in particular with enhanced soil moisture and lake description, and an overall better agreement of river discharge estimations with available observations. However, ERA5-Land snow depth fields present a mixed performance when compared to those of ERA5, depending on geographical location and altitude. The description of the energy cycle shows comparable results with ERA5. Nevertheless, ERA5-Land reduces the global averaged root mean square error of the skin temperature, taking as reference MODIS data, mainly due to the contribution of coastal points where spatial resolution is important. Since January 2020, the ERA5-Land period available has extended from January 1981 to the near present, with a 2- to 3-month delay with respect to real time. The segment prior to 1981 is in production, aiming for a release of the whole dataset in summer/autumn 2021. The high spatial and temporal resolution of ERA5-Land, its extended period, and the consistency of the fields produced makes it a valuable dataset to support hydrological studies, to initialize NWP and climate models, and to support diverse applications dealing with water resource, land, and environmental management.  The full ERA5-Land hourly (Mu{\~n}oz-Sabater, 2019a) and monthly (Mu{\~n}oz-Sabater, 2019b) averaged datasets presented in this paper are available through the C3S Climate Data Store at https://doi.org/10.24381/cds.e2161bac and https://doi.org/10.24381/cds.68d2bb30, respectively.},

This study's objective was to characterize the effects of climatic variation on the interannual stem growth rate of eight species in tropical wet forest. Six trees per species were selected (n = 48 trees), and a dendrometer was installed to measure diametric growth bi-monthly between 2015 and 2018 (3 years), complemented with environmental measurements, to determine their growth equations from environmental variables and, finally, to define the relationship between the wood density and the stem growth rate. The results showed an average stem growth from 0.45 to 4.35 mm year-1, and 40 to 70\% growth occurred in the months with the highest rainfall. Also, species with higher wood densities were found to have lower stem growth rates. Finally, the analysis of stem growth rate showed a significant relationship in all species between the variables of temperature and precipitation (R2 adj 0.88 to 0.96). Our results suggest that species with greater stem growth rates in wet tropical forests are more susceptible to climate changes, which may affect their dynamics in the face of potential drought scenarios and heat waves associated with climate change.},
